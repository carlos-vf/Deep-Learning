## Key Phase 2 Features

### 1. **Smart Data Utilization**
- Extract frames from your 17 videos strategically
- Use existing ground truth annotations
- Implement data augmentation for underwater scenes
- Handle class imbalance (many fish vs background)

### 2. **Transfer Learning Strategy**
- Start with YOLOv8n/YOLOv8s pre-trained on COCO
- Fine-tune specifically for fish detection
- Preserve learned features, adapt to underwater domain
- Much faster than training from scratch

### 3. **Underwater-Specific Augmentations**
- Color jittering (underwater lighting variations)
- Blur simulation (water turbidity)
- Brightness/contrast changes (depth variations)
- Mosaic augmentation (multiple fish scenarios)

### 4. **Training Monitoring**
- Real-time loss tracking
- Validation accuracy monitoring
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Model checkpointing for best performance

### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **mAP@0.5**: Mean Average Precision at 50% IoU
- **Precision/Recall**: Per-class performance
- **F1-Score**: Balanced metric
- **Inference Speed**: FPS on your hardware

## Expected Phase 2 Outcomes

### Performance Targets
- **Detection Accuracy**: 70-85% mAP@0.5 (vs 0-5% in Phase 1)

### Week 1 Deliverable
- Working training pipeline that can train on your fish data
- Initial trained model (even if accuracy is low)
- Baseline metrics to improve upon
- Clear understanding of training process

The key to Phase 2 success is **iterative improvement** - start simple, get something working, then progressively make it better. Your high-quality ground truth data (374 fish annotations!) gives you a huge advantage for training and evaluation.
